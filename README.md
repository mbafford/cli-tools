# About

Collection of utilities I use on the command line. Not organized in any specific way.

Mostly Python scripts. Increasingly Python scripts designed around [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), using `#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script` and [PEP 723](https://peps.python.org/pep-0723/) script dependency comments to simplify running without managing Python virtual environments.  Many thanks to [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/19/one-shot-python-tools/) for evangelizing this approach.

My related browser-based repository: [mbafford/browser-tools](https://github.com/mbafford/browser-tools) - some scripts here have HTML "run anywhere" versions there.
